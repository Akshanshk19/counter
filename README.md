Counter App

This repository contains my first Android app named Counter, which was developed during a college Android development workshop. The app provides basic functionality to increment, decrement and reset an integer value using respective buttons.

App Features:

Increment Button: Increases the integer count by 1.

Decrement Button: Decreases the integer count by 1.

Reset Function: Allows the user to reset the counter to zero.
